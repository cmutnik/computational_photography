# Computational Photography #

This will serve as a repository for:
- computational photography tools
- tips/tricks that have proven useful

`# TODO: Get rid of dir tree, no need for it:`

> [`ascii_art/`](./ascii_art/): Simple python script to convert an image to ascii art (needs much refining).

> [`boarders_and_thumbnails/`](./boarders_and_thumbnails/): Python scripts for adding boarders to images and generating thumbnails.

> [`compress_images/`](./compress_images/): Python script for compressing images, to save github storage space.

> [`figs/`](./figs/): Centralized storage location for images displayed in repo.

> [`image_stacking/`](./image_stacking/): Python scripts for stacking multiple images into into one.

> [`machine_learning/`](./machine_learning/) Implement machine learning as computational photography tools.
>> [`apply_GANs/`](./machine_learning/apply_GANs/) Apply GANs to manipulate images based on trained models.
>> [`paintings_from_images/`](./machine_learning/paintings_from_images/): Various methods of turning photographs into paintings.

> [`resize_image/`](./resize_image/): Python script for resizing input images.

> [`time_slice/`](./time_slice/): (Outdated and incomplete dir.)

> [`time_slice_tile_mosaic/`](./time_slice_tile_mosaic/): Used to stitch images together in a cross/mosaic pattern.

> [`video_editing/`](./video_editing/): Shell scripts for breaking videos down into constituent frames.

> [`zoom_virtual_backgrounds/`](./zoom_virtual_backgrounds/): Python scripts for modifying images to fit requirements of zoom virtual backgrounds.

This repo in not complete.  It is serving as a backup during computer migration.  Please contact me with any questions.  All codes should be completed (with documentation), in the future.
