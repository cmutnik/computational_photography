# Machine Leaning #

Implement machine learning as computational photography tools.

**TODO:** Look into
- Go through notebooks [here](https://github.com/eugenesiow/practical-ml).
- [`detectron2`](https://github.com/DDemmer1/ai-background-remove) -- "Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation library that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms."
- [Implementation](https://github.com/DDemmer1/ai-background-remove) of `detectron2`.
