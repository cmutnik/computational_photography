# Convert Photos to Paintings #

The neural nets used in [runwayml](https://app.runwayml.com/) need to be optimized using newer techniques, but are overall pretty great.  A free account allows you to modify images and videos in a variety of styles.

```sh
.
├── image_to_paint/
└── pointillism/
```

> [image_to_paint/](./image_to_paint/) generates images to look as if the are being built up by brush strokes.

> [pointillism/](./pointillism/) creates a painting of the style the dir is named for.
