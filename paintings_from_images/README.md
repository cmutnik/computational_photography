> The neural nets used in [runwayml](https://app.runwayml.com/) need to be optimized using newer techniques, but are overall pretty great.  A free account allows you to modify images and videos in a variety of styles.  Their source code is linked for each model, to test it out go to [adaptive-style-transfer.](https://github.com/CompVis/adaptive-style-transfer)
