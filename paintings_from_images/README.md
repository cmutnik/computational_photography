The neural nets used in [runwayml](https://app.runwayml.com/) need to be optimized using newer techniques, but are overall pretty great.  A free account allows you to modify images and videos in a variety of styles.  Their source code is linked for each model, to test it out go [here.](https://github.com/cmutnik/adaptive-style-transfer.git)

```sh
.
├── image_to_paint/
└── pointillism/
```

> [adaptive-style-transfer](https://github.com/cmutnik/adaptive-style-transfer.git)

> [pointillism/](./pointillism/) creates a painting of the style the dir is named for. <img src="../../figs/paintings/IMG_3477_1_drawing.jpg" width="5%">

> [image_to_paint/](./image_to_paint/) generates images to look as if the are being built up by brush strokes. <img src="../../figs/paintings/IMG_3477_1_image_to_paint.jpg" width="5%">
